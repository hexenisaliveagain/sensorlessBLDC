# sensorlessBLDC
Sensorless BLDC driver project that aims to create cheap, simple, powerfull and versitile BLDC motor controller. Project consists of source code that runs on ATMEGA 328P and uses internal comparator module to guess right moent for cummutation execution. Projcet is curently IN WORKS.

Project uses very simple control mechanism. It uses fixed error corretion value to tune motor speed.

PROJECT IS SUPPLIED AS IS AND I SHALL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY USING MY CODE, SCHEMATIC, PCB DESIGN OR ANY WORK I HAVE POSTED HERE. PROJECT IS FULLY CREATED BY MACIEJ GAŁDA FOR HIS EE DEGREE ON POLITECHNIKA RZESZOWSKA IM. INGACEGO ŁUKASIEWICZA IN ACADEMIC YEAR OF 2022/2023
